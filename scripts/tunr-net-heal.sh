# tunr-net-heal.sh — restore the relay -> app-container network path.
#
# The `tunr-apps` bridge runs with icc=false so tenant containers cannot reach
# each other. That rule is indiscriminate: it blocks the RELAY too. The relay is
# allowed through by an explicit DOCKER-USER ACCEPT keyed on its current IP.
#
# Two things make that rule fragile:
#
#   • iptables rules are in-memory. A host reboot wipes DOCKER-USER, and nothing
#     puts the rule back — the stack comes up looking healthy while every cloud
#     app returns 503, because the relay cannot dial any of them.
#   • the relay's IP on tunr-apps is assigned by Docker and changes whenever the
#     container is recreated, so a statically saved rule would go stale anyway.
#
# So the rule has to be *recomputed*, not persisted — after every relay
# recreate and on every boot. This script is that logic, installed as a systemd
# oneshot (tunr-net-heal.service); run it again after recreating the relay.
#
# Idempotent: deletes any prior copy of the rule before inserting, so repeated
# runs cannot stack duplicates.
#
# Usage:
#   tunr-net-heal.sh              # heal now
#   tunr-net-heal.sh --install    # install + enable the systemd unit, then heal
